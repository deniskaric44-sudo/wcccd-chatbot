Section Menu Home > Dual Enrollment Dual Enrollment Dual enrollment programs are a jumpstart to your future. As a high school student, you can take advantage of Wayne County Community College District courses and transfer them to a four-year college of your choice. Is Dual Enrollment Right for Me? Dual enrollment allows you to earn college credit for classes while still in high school. The more credits you have when you enter college, the faster you can obtain a degree and start your future. Who Can Participate? Dual enrollment is open to all students in grades 9-12 or those enrolled in a Wayne County Public School, including participating private and charter schools. Students enrolled in home school are also eligible to participate. Get started Explore Dual Enrollment today Apply Parents: Give Your Child a Head Start on Success With Dual Enrollment Classes Enroll your child in dual enrollment to: Sharpen academic skills: Dual enrollment students are better prepared because they’ve already experienced the rigor of college-level classes. Save Time: Earning college credit while still in high school may allow your son or daughter to complete one or two years of college. Save Money: High schools usually pay for dual enrollment courses and college textbooks, which means dual enrollment students do little to nothing. Tuition for Dual Enrollment courses is the same as all WCCCD courses and significantly less than that of a typical four-year college. Increase the chance for success in college: Once dual enrollment students begin college, their dual enrollment classes allow them to take fewer classes each semester and still graduate on time. Submit the Parent Consent Form to determine child’s eligibility for the program. FAQs What is the difference between dual enrollment and advanced placement? Dual enrollment courses allow you to receive a grade and credit for the work performed throughout the school year. These credits may transfer to your college of choice as direct course equivalents (verify with your university and/or community college major of study). Review the MACRO A agreement to see how community college courses transfer to other Michigan universities. If you are planning to attend an out-of-state university, check with that institution to see how credits will transfer. Advanced placement classes prepare you to pass the AP test to earn college credit. Credit is awarded solely on your performance on this one exam and may transfer to colleges as an elective or required credit based on your program of study and the college/university you plan to attend. How do I enroll? Your high school will distribute a dual enrollment packet containing all of the information needed for dual enrollment, including applying for admissions, testing requirements and class registration. Once completed, the registration form must be signed and submitted through the high school contact. What happens if I don’t pay my tuition? You may be dropped from your class with a debt still owed to the college and you will receive a grade of “WI” on your permanent college transcripts if you do not drop before the 100% refund date. What if I change my mind about taking classes? It is your responsibility, not your instructor’s, to officially withdraw from your classes. You will need to contact your college dual enrollment office and complete a drop/add slip. If you withdraw after the 100% refund date, you will still be responsible for paying your tuition. NOTE: Notifying your instructor that you no longer want to take the course for dual credit is not officially withdrawing from the course. How do I send my transcripts to another college? Go to the 'My Wildcat Portal': Log in with your student email and password. In the \"Student\" category, click the \"Order Official Transcript\" card. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. Transcripts within the Wayne County Community College District are free. Transcripts sent outside the Community College District cost $5 each. Apply Now Register Pay for College"

It’s like earning a paycheck – you need to attend classes, complete your assignments, and maintain good grades to keep it. And just like a job, the funding can be affected if you don’t meet the requirements. Most financial aid is awarded based on financial need as defined by the federal government. But even if you don’t qualify for need-based aid, you can still apply for a federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. While you need to repay this loan, the interest rate and repayment terms are generally more favorable than private loans. Additionally, you might be eligible for various scholarships to help cover your costs. Financial Aid TV Need guidance on applying for aid?

In divisive times, the messages from three metro Detroit leaders were welcome — collaborating for the best possible outcome, empowering people to achieve their potential, uniting to make an impact. The three leaders accepted awards for their work in skilled trades, community development and education on Tuesday, Oct. 7, during the 18th annual Shining Light Awards at Ford Field. Nearly 300 people from across metro Detroit gathered to recognize their achievements. “We are living in uncharted times and sometimes it’s very unsettling,” said Lisa Johanon, executive director and co-founder of Central Detroit Christian Community Development, who accepted the Eleanor Josaitis Unsung Hero Award. “But, friends, it’s not about you or me. It’s about us and we. We, joining together to help a hurting world.” That spirit of unity reflects the purpose of the Shining Light Awards, which recognize people who build bridges across communities and promote regional cooperation and understanding. The awards honor the legacies of late Free Press Editor and Publisher Neal Shine, late civil rights activist and Focus: HOPE Co-founder Eleanor Josaitis, and basketball legend and former Detroit Mayor Dave Bing. The program is presented by the Metropolitan Affairs Coalition and the Detroit Free Press. Curtis L. Ivery — Neal Shine Award for Exemplary Regional Leadership Curtis Ivery has led Wayne County Community College District for 30 years as chancellor of the six-campus college. When he arrived, the institution was struggling, with three presidents in five years, board infighting and frequent administrative turnover. Ivery, now 76, expected to stay only a few years, but he remained to oversee an era of growth. Under his leadership, WCCCD expanded its campuses, improved facilities and modernized course offerings. About 12,000 students enroll in degree programs each fall and spring semester, while another 40,000 take part in non-degree and vocational programs each year. “We are about collaboration,” Ivery said as he accepted the award. “When we can’t get it done at one location, we have no problem reaching out to another location to put in place whatever is necessary to serve students.” Lisa Johanon — Eleanor Josaitis Unsung Hero Award Lisa Johanon co-founded Central Detroit Christian Community Development Corp. in 1993 to provide youth programming after a national organization she worked for ended its Detroit operations. Since then, the organization has expanded to offer early education programs, job training, small business development and housing support in Detroit’s 48202 and 48206 ZIP codes. It has repaired more than 700 homes, helped nearly 800 Detroiters become first-time homeowners and manages more than 100 affordable housing units. “If there’s ever a time for regional cooperation instead of division, it’s now,” Johanon said. “We need to set aside our political differences, our economic differences, our cultural differences and any other petty differences we may have with each other.” John Perkins Jr. — Dave Bing Young Leader Award John Perkins Jr. lives in a home his father built — a symbol of the generational wealth his family has worked to sustain. That experience introduced him to carpentry and inspired his career in the skilled trades. Now a business representative for the Michigan Regional Council of Carpenters and Millwrights, Perkins connects young people to apprenticeship opportunities and started a monthly mentoring program that features guest speakers and career resources. “We’ve mastered the art of construction, the science, the engineering, the logistics,” Perkins said. “But what if our greatest achievement isn’t found in the buildings we raise but in the people we uplift? The true measure of our success isn’t just in the concrete or the framework — it’s in human potential, the lives we touch and the communities we nurture.” Date Posted October 14, 2025 Categories News, Chancellor News, Homepage Related News 2025 Annual Rainbow PUSH/CEF Global Automotive Summit: Diversity at the Heart of Innovation and Growth As the automotive industry faces unprecedented challenges and transformative change, the 2025 Annual Rainbow PUSH/CEF Global Automotive Summit returns to Detroit with a renewed focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Section Menu Steps to Enroll Apply Orientation Register or Find a Class International Students Veterans Adult Education Prior Learning Assessment Advanced Placement Credit ACCUPLACER Continuing Education Home > Prior Learning Assessment Prior Learning Assessment We recognize that many of our students come to us with a wealth of learning achieved through experiences outside a college classroom. The College sponsors several programs to help students convert those learning experiences into college credits that may be applied toward a certificate or degree. These include the Articulation Program, Credit by Examination, the College Level Examination, and Credit for Experiential Learning and Specialized Experience. Contact the Campus Admissions Office or the Campus Academic Officer for additional information on the programs listed below. Options to Prior Learning Credit Credit for Pre-College Learning Wayne County Community College District recognizes that many of our students come to us with a wealth of learning which was achieved through experiences outside a college classroom. The College sponsors several programs which are designed to help students convert those learning experiences into college credit that may be applied toward a certificate or degree. These include the Articulation Program, Credit by Examination, the College Level Examination, Credit for Experiential Learning and Credit for Specialized Experience. Contact the Campus Admissions Office or the Campus Academic Officer for additional Information on the programs listed below. Credit by Examination Credit may be earned for some courses in the current catalog through special examination upon the recommendation of the academic officer, program director, or program committee. Credit earned in this manner will satisfy degree and certificate requirements. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) The CLEP test is based on the premise that individuals acquire knowledge informally throughout their lives. The test allows them to convert this knowledge into college credit. This opportunity may be particularly useful to the occupational career student, adult student, and the student who did not graduate from high school but who has acquired some special expertise. There are two types of CLEP tests available: the General Examinations, which measure knowledge in basic liberal arts areas (English composition, humanities, mathematics, and social science — history), and the Subject Examinations which measure achievement in 37 specific college courses. When prior college credit has been earned on a formal basis in the subject area, no CLEP credit will be allowed. Credit is granted for tests with scores which rank at the 50th percentile or higher based on sophomore norms presented in tables of percentile ranks provided by the College Entrance Examination Board, which developed and standardized the CLEP test. A maximum of one year of credit (30 semester hours) may be allowed for pre-college learning. This credit will apply toward WCCCD degrees and certificates. Most examinations are given once each month and may be taken by WCCCD students at the Counseling and Testing Bureau of Wayne State University. Descriptive brochures and applications are available at Wayne State University, 5050 Cass Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48202. Credit for Experiential Learning If you wish to receive credit for learning you have achieved through experience but do not wish to use the CLEP or Credit by Examination programs, you may take advantage of our experiential learning program. To do this you must prepare a portfolio which includes the following information: 1. Courses you wish credit for2. Learning goals that you have achieved3. Documentation of the achievement of the learning goals This portfolio is then reviewed by our faculty to determine if credit may be awarded. Several things about  experiential learning are important to understand as you consider using this opportunity to earn credit. First, credit is granted for learning achieved from experience, not for the experience itself. In developing your portfolio, you will need to demonstrate that your experiences have helped you gain both theoretical and practical knowledge at the same level as you would have achieved by taking the course. Second, the process of developing a successful portfolio is as time consuming as taking a course. Therefore, we recommend that you consider this option only if you wish to receive credit for a group of courses. Credit for a single course is earned more efficiently through credit by examination or the CLEP program. There is a $10 processing fee for credit for experiential learning. In addition the fee for this service is an amount equal to half the normal tuition for the courses you are seeking credit for. The campus academic officer or program director can provide you with the directions and the forms necessary to receive credit for experiential learning. Credit for Specialized Experience Wayne County Community College District will grant four credit hours of credit, without fee payment, for the Fire Academy, Police Academy, Emergency Medical Training, military service, 20WAYNE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT conscientious objector, Peace Corps, or Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA) service and experience, subject to the following stipulations: Credit will be granted only for one of these training or service experiences. Credit for military service will be granted only for one year or more active duty service. Credit for Fire and Police Academy experience will be granted only after completion of academy training and one year of active duty with a public fire protection or law enforcement agency. Credit for Peace Corps and VISTA experience will be granted only after completion of the appropriate tour of duty. Credit for conscientious objector service will be granted only for those objectors who rendered service to the community as a result of their legally determined conscientious objector status. This credit will not satisfy any part of the 15 credits at WCCCD required for graduation. This credit is general elective credit and does not apply toward the fulfillment of any general education requirement for a degree. This credit will be recorded on the student’s academic record, without grade, as follows: COE 999 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4 credits Conscientious Objector Service EMS 999 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .4 credits Emergency Medical Training FAE 999. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 credits Fire Academy Experience MSE 999 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 credits Military Service Experience PAE 999. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 credits Police Academy Experience PCE 999 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 credits Peace Corps Experience VSE 999. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 credits VISTA Experience To obtain this credit, students must meet the following criteria: a.

Contact 313-496-2862 for further information. Obtaining Credit for Experience The student acquires a Credit for Experience application. Prior to completing the application, the student must meet with his/her appropriate academic administrator or campus advisor to review the appropriateness of requesting credit for experience. The student completes the application and attaches all necessary documentation. The student submits an application to the Instruction and Accountability office for approval from the appropriate academic administrator. The Educational Affairs office will notify the student of the final recommendation within four weeks. Upon the approval of the appropriate academic administrator: The cashier computes the charge, collects funds, stamps all copies of the form set as “PAID” and retains one copy. The student retains one copy stamped “PAID” and returns the remaining copies to the District Records Office. The student records office enters the credit as “CFE” into the computer master transcript file and retains the original in the student’s hard copy file.

The program combines classroom instruction with hands-on laboratory work to educate students in key areas of the brewing process. Coursework includes brewing and fermentation, safety and sanitation, brewing equipment, marketing, management, and the agriculture and microbiology of craft beer. Graduates of the program will be fully prepared to sit for certification exams offered by the Institute of Brewing and Distilling (IBD) and pursue employment in local and national brewing establishments. What Do Craft Brewers Do? Craft brewers are responsible for every step of the brewing process. They set up, operate, and maintain the equipment used to produce beer, including filter presses, centrifuges, fermenting tanks, and batch stills. These machines help extract and separate materials to produce the final product. Brewers also maintain the brewing process's quality, safety, and sanitation. Where Do Craft Brewers Work? Craft brewers typically work in microbreweries or craft breweries, which are small-scale, independently owned-operations. These breweries focus on producing high-quality, flavorful beer and often emphasize unique brewing techniques. Craft brewers produce, bottle, and pack beer in these smaller, specialized settings. Job Outlook for Craft Brewers Employment in craft brewing, particularly in beer sales and retail, is projected to decline by 1% from 2022 to 2032. As the number of craft breweries increases and financial regulations become stricter, there will be a greater demand for workers to maintain books and provide accounting services within the industry.

This program specifically prepares students for employment in correctional institutions or fields related to probation and parole. What Do Criminal Justice Professionals Do? Correctional officers oversee individuals who have been arrested and are awaiting trial or who have been sentenced to serve time in jail, reformatory, or prison. They ensure the safety and security of the institution, as well as maintain order among the inmates. Probation officers and correctional treatment specialists work with offenders under supervision to monitor their behavior, provide guidance, and help prevent recidivism. Where Do They Work? Correctional officers, probation officers, and correctional treatment specialists typically work in correctional facilities, such as jails, prisons, halfway houses, or alternative support service environments. In rural areas, probation officers may travel frequently to visit offenders, and many correctional officers work long hours, managing extensive paperwork and meeting court-imposed deadlines. Officers may also work in hospitals or community-based facilities, depending on the nature of the offenders they supervise. Job Outlook for Correctional Officers The employment outlook for correctional officers is projected to decline by 7% from 2022 to 2032. This decline is primarily due to changes in sentencing laws, which are leading to fewer incarcerations and increasing use of alternatives to prison, such as probation and rehabilitation programs.

Emphasis is on successfully creating and sustaining a competitive advantage in starting, managing, and growing a small business. This program focuses on the preparation needed for small business ownership. Entrepreneurship plays a vital role in the growth of the U.S. economy. It is a process through which individuals identify opportunities, allocate resources, and create value. This creation of value is often through the identification of unmet needs or opportunities for change. Do you want to start a business? The Business Daily News defines an entrepreneur as “identifying a need and starting a business to fill it.” Entrepreneurs are innovators, a source of new ideas, goods, and services or expanding on what’s already existing. One risk of starting a new business often comes from a lack of preparation: Is it a viable idea? The Entrepreneurship Certificate will provide you with the key areas of consideration to ensure you understand the complexities of business startups. You need to manage and market your business; there are courses for that. You may have employees or even contractors; you need to know a bit about human resources and business law. How will you finance your business? There’s a course for that, too. The Entrepreneurship program will open your eyes to what is required to start a new business.

The Fire Protection Technology Degree addresses the needs of those who want to be entry-level firefighters, those desiring advancement within their fire careers, and those seeking fire-related jobs within companies. Firefighters use high-pressure hoses to suppress structural fires. Firefighters protect the public by responding to fires and other emergencies. They are frequently the first emergency personnel on the scene of an accident. Firefighters’ duties may change several times while they are at the scene of an emergency. In some cases, they might remain at disaster scenes for days, rescuing trapped survivors and assisting with medical treatment. Some firefighters work in hazardous materials units and are specially trained to control, prevent, and clean up hazardous materials, such as oil spills and chemical accidents. What’s the Job Outlook for Firefighters? Employment of firefighters is projected to grow 4 percent from 2022 to 2032, which is about as fast as the average for all occupations. Population growth and an aging population are expected to increase demand for firefighters, as more emergency calls arise and the majority of responses shift toward medical emergencies. Additionally, the transition from volunteer to paid firefighter positions in growing areas will create more jobs, particularly in urban regions where full-time firefighters are more common.

Welding is the most common way of permanently joining metal parts. Heat is applied to metal pieces in this process, melting and fusing them to form a permanent bond. Because of its strength, welding is used in shipbuilding, automobile manufacturing and repair, aerospace applications, and thousands of other manufacturing activities. It is also used to join beams in the construction of buildings, bridges, and other structures and to join pipes in pipelines, power plants, and refineries. Where Do They Work? Welders work in various industries and settings, from car racing to manufacturing. The work they do and the equipment they use vary depending on the industry. What’s the Job Outlook for positions as Welders, Cutters, Solderers, and Brazers?

Complete online courses whenever you choose. Join real-time classes from a distance. Mix distance and on-campus courses for maximum flexibility. Choose from three types of distance courses: online, live online, or interactive. Each offers its own advantages. But all teach the same content, develop the same skills, and carry the same transfer credit as traditional campus-based courses. If you’re a high school student, consider Virtual Middle College, a convenient way to earn college credits online. You can also explore interests and build job skills through the School of Continuing Education’s e-Learning Center. New Distance Learning Students Just registered for an online course or another distance learning option? Start by completing an online orientation and a few other essential steps. Start Learning Online How to Be Successful Taking Classes Online Self-Discipline You might be attracted to the flexibility that online learning offers, but remember that this flexibility requires you to be motivated and self-disciplined. To succeed in online courses, you must prioritize your educational goals and focus on your coursework. If you can stick to a plan and put in the effort necessary to succeed, online learning could be a great fit for you. Time Management Unlike traditional classes with set schedules and structures, online classes require you to manage your own time and set your own priorities. You must allocate time for participating in your online courses, studying, and completing assignments. To be successful, you should develop and stick to a plan, stay ahead of your tasks, and seek help when needed. Balancing your educational goals with other life responsibilities can be challenging, but the flexibility of online learning makes it possible. Organizational Skills Balancing a busy schedule with work, family, and education can be tough, but it’s achievable with the right mindset and approach. You should set goals, establish a pace to reach them, and keep track of your progress. Most importantly, be prepared to adapt when things don’t go as planned. If this approach sounds like how you handle challenges, then online learning might be the best way for you to achieve your educational goals. How Do Distance Courses Fit My Schedule? Online courses fit almost any schedule. You can complete fully online courses and programs on your own time. Or you can join live online or hybrid courses at their scheduled times, saving the time and costs of commuting. If you are working toward a degree or certificate from WCCCD, which offers fully online degrees and certificates, you can usually complete up to 49% of your program’s requirements in other program areas online. Types of Online Courses Online with Virtual Class Meetings These are fully online instructor-led courses, with live interactive weekly class meetings facilitated by your instructor in Blackboard. Meetings and communication are through chat, email, and/or videoconferencing. Faculty and students are online at the same time for the class meetings, with additional online work done on their own. Online with No Live Class Meetings These are fully online, instructor-led courses without mandatory class meetings. Instructor communication and feedback are through Blackboard. Students can access class resources and complete work on their own schedule (by posted due dates) as the instructor releases materials. Faculty and students are not necessarily online simultaneously unless an appointment is scheduled. Hybrid Courses For those of you who would prefer to take advantage of the best features of both face-to-face and online learning, WCCCD offers hybrid courses that combine in person and online delivery. Hybrid courses (also known as blended courses) replace a portion of traditional face-to-face instruction with web-based online learning (e.g., video lectures, online discussions, or activities). Typically, hybrid courses will meet 50 percent of the time in the classroom and 50 percent online. Need Technical Support?

I must meet the standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) to maintain my financial aid eligibility. If I fail to meet SAP standards, or adhere to my SAP academic plan, I will lose my eligibility and will be responsible for all expenses I incur. (See https://www.wcccd.edu/financial-aid/satisfactory-academic-progress) I must be pursuing an eligible degree or a certificate in a financial aid eligible program.

If eligible, Pell Grants will be awarded automatically on Web-Gate. Reminder, you must complete the 2024-25 FAFSA in order to determine your financial aid eligibility. The Year Round Pell Grant regulation no longer requires students to enroll in a minimum 6 credit hours to be eligible to receive the Year Round Pell Grant during Summer 2025 semester. The Summer Loan Request Form is available now on WCCCD Student Forms and the Federal Work Study application is available on the Financial Aid Forms page. Guest students are not eligible to receive Title IV aid at WCCCD. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) statuses will be updated at the end of Spring 2025 semester for the upcoming Fall 2025 semester for all students. Students who have been approved for academic plans, probation or enrolled in programs 1 year or less in length will also be evaluated at the end of the Spring 2025 semester. Students that choose to utilize a book voucher for Summer semester prior to receiving an updated SAP status for Summer semester, may be financially responsible for their purchases if they are no longer financial aid eligible due to SAP. All state programs (Michigan Reconnect, Futures for Frontliners, TIP and Michigan Achievement Scholarship) are currently being awarded on Web-Gate. You must enroll and meet all eligibility requirements prior to being awarded. During the 2024-25 award year, the Department of Education has reprocessed some FAFSA applications. You are encouraged to monitor Web-Gate messages, Student Requirements and tasks on WCCCD Student Forms to make sure that additional documents have not been requested for submission. This can even occur after you have received a financial aid disbursement and refund. If you fail to submit required documentation, it can result in a reversal of financial aid awards and a balance could be owed. REMINDERS: Federal regulations do not allow payment for courses that do not count toward your declared major. Also federal regulations do not allow payment for courses that are repeated more than once after passing the course. The 2025-26 FAFSA is available on https://studentaid.gov for students that plan to enroll for the 2025-26 academic year. Please be prepared and start early for the next school year!

Home > Financial Aid > Federal Programs Federal Programs Federal Pell Grant The federal government funds this grant, and eligibility is determined by the U.S. Department of Education. The maximum grant is $7395, depending upon the Student Aid Index (SAI) and the number of credit hours you are enrolled in. The Federal Pell Grant is limited to students who have not received a baccalaureate degree. A FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS) is sent to the student by https://studentaid.gov. An award notification is issued to eligible students by the District's Financial Aid Office. Students are eligible for Pell Grants for a maximum of the equivalent of 12 full-time semesters. Pell Grant Lifetime EligibilityThe amount of Federal Pell Grant funds a student may receive over his or her lifetime is limited to the equivalent of six (full-time) years of Pell Grant funding.  Since the maximum amount of Pell Grant funding a student can receive each year is equal to 100%, the six-year equivalent is 600%. Log on to the U.S. Department of Education website for more detailed information regarding Lifetime Eligibility (LEU) here. Stafford Federal Direct Student LoansFederal Direct Loans are either subsidized or unsubsidized Direct Loans. A subsidized loan is awarded based on financial need. You will not be charged any interest during authorized periods of deferment. The federal government “subsidizes” the interest during these periods. An unsubsidized loan is not awarded based on need. You will be charged interest from the time the loan is disbursed until it is paid in full. Suppose you allow the interest to accrue (accumulate) while you are in school or during other periods of nonpayment. In that case, it will be capitalized — that is, the interest will be added to the principal amount of your loan, and additional interest will be based on that higher amount. If your interest is capitalized, it will increase the amount you have to repay. You can choose to pay the interest as it accumulates; if so, you will repay less in the long run. For more information regarding Federal Direct Loans, click here. Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) This is a federal grant for undergraduates only. The District Financial Aid Office awards Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant funds. The amount of the grant is determined by the student's needs and the funds' availability.

Federal Work-Study (FWS)This federally subsidized employment program employs students with demonstrated financial need who wish to earn part of their educational expenses.

Interested students must complete a renewal application, an electronic application, or the Free Application for Federal Financial Aid form.

No WCCCD employee with responsibilities related to student loans shall enter into a contract arrangement with a lender or lender affiliate. No such employee may accept from any lender or lender affiliate any fee, payment, or other financial benefit as compensation for any consulting arrangement or contract to provide services to or on behalf of a lender relating to student loans. WCCCD participates in the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan program, which provides student loans through the U.S. Department of Education. WCCCD does not utilize preferred lenders for the private student loan sector. WCCCD will not steer students toward any particular private lender nor delay the certification of such loans. WCCCD does not assign first-time borrowers’ student loans to any particular lender through award packaging or any other method. As a Direct Loan participant, loans are provided through the U.S. Department of Education. WCCCD will not request or accept from any lender, guarantor, or servicer any offer of funds for private student loans, including funds for an opportunity pool loan, to students in exchange for concessions or promises to the lender, guarantor, or servicer for a specific number or volume of student loans, or a preferred lender arrangement.  An “opportunity pool loan” is defined by HEOA as a private education loan made by a lender to a student (or the student’s family) that involves a payment by the institution to the lender for extending credit to the student. WCCCD will not request or accept assistance with call center or financial aid office staffing from any lender, guarantor, or servicer of student loans. The exception is that a lender may provide professional development training, educational counseling materials, assistance to borrowing students regarding specific processes, and other services provided on behalf of WCCCD. Any WCCCD employee with responsibilities related to student loans may serve on the advisory board, commission, or group established by a lender(s) or guarantor(s).  That employee is prohibited from receiving anything of value from the lender(s), guarantor(s), or group except for the reimbursement of reasonable expenses incurred in carrying out the duties of serving on the board.

If I drop below full-time status, my award will be reduced or, in some cases, eliminated. I must enroll in at least six credit hours to receive the Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG), Federal Direct Loan, Iraq Afghanistan Service Grant, or Tuition Incentive Program (TIP). It is my responsibility to report any changes in income or assets that may result in an adjustment of my financial needs. I am not eligible for this award if I defaulted on a Perkins or Stafford loan or if I owe a repayment on a federal grant. To be eligible for this award, I must comply with Satisfactory Academic Progress standards. The financial aid website, www.wcccd.edu, provides detailed policy and appeals process information. To receive work study funds, I must be enrolled in at least six credit hours and then secure employment through the Federal Work Study Placement Office. I must enroll and take classes in an eligible degree or certificate program to receive financial aid funds. I am aware that my classes must count toward my program of study in order to be eligible for financial aid. It is my responsibility to ensure that my classes are actually required for my program before enrolling. The District Financial Aid Office has the right to review, adjust, or cancel the financial aid award at any time due to notification from the U.S. Department of Education, a change in the student’s FAFSA, financial, marital, or academic status, or because of adjustments (changes) in federal or state regulations, funding or computational errors. Students may accept any number of awards or other financial assistance from public or private sources or both. However, the total assistance may not exceed the cost of attendance. I have the right to obtain information regarding financial aid programs through WCCCD and may discuss my award and related information with appropriate college financial aid staff. I may file an appeal regarding my aid award or denial of aid based on extenuating circumstances or new information that I provide. In responding to my appeal, the financial aid office must comply with all state and federal laws. All appeals MUST be made to the financial aid office in writing. Financial aid is not automatically renewed for the next year. I must apply with the U.S. Department of Education, complete the required forms in a timely manner, and maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress to remain eligible. I am responsible for completing all classes for which I registered.

Home > Financial Aid > Loan Repayment Options Loan Repayment Options Exit CounselingIf you have received federal student loans and you have graduated, stopped attending or dropped below six credit hours, you are required, in accordance with Department of Education regulations, to complete exit counseling. You may submit exit counseling online by going to https://studentaid.gov/h/manage-loans. Borrower Grace PeriodsAfter you graduate, leave school, or drop below half-time enrollment, you have a period of time before you have to begin repayment. This \"grace period\" will be six months for a Federal Stafford Loan (Direct Loan ProgramSM or Federal Family Education Loan (FFELSM) Program). If your loans were first disbursed from July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2014, the federal government will not pay the interest during your grace period. Make Your Payments on TimeYour loan servicer will provide information about repayment and will notify you of the date loan repayment begins. It is very important that you make your full loan payment on time either monthly (which is usually when you'll pay) or according to your repayment schedule. If you don't, you could end up in default, which has serious consequences. Student loans are real loans—just as real as car loans or mortgages. You have to pay back your student loans. Click the link below for information regarding each repayment option:https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment/plans Trouble Making PaymentsIf you're having trouble paying your loans, contact your loan servicer as soon as possible. Your servicer will work with you to determine the best option for you. Options include:• Changing repayment plans.• Requesting a deferment—If you meet certain requirements, a deferment allows you to temporarily stop making loan payments.• Requesting a forbearance—If you don't meet the eligibility requirements for a deferment but are temporarily unable to make your loan payments, then (in limited circumstances) a forbearance allows you to temporarily stop making payments on your loan, temporarily make smaller payments, or extend the time for making payments.If you stop making payments and don't get a deferment or forbearance, your loan could go into default (see Default section below), which has serious consequences. Postponing RepaymentIf you have trouble making your education loan payments, contact immediately the organization that services your loan. You might qualify for a deferment, forbearance, or other form of payment relief. It's important to take action before you are charged late fees. For Direct and FFEL Stafford Loans, contact your loan servicer. If you do not know who your servicer is, you can look it up in the U.S. Department of Education’s National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS). DefermentYou can receive a deferment for certain defined periods. A deferment is a temporary suspension of loan payments for specific situations such as re-enrollment in school, unemployment, or economic hardship. You don’t have to pay interest on the loan during deferment if you have a subsidized Direct or FFEL, Stafford Loan or a Federal Perkins Loan. If you have an unsubsidized Direct or FFEL Stafford Loan, you’re responsible for the interest during deferment. If you don’t pay the interest as it accrues (accumulates), it will be capitalized (added to the loan principal), and the amount you have to pay in the future will be higher. You have to apply for a deferment to your loan servicer (the organization that handles your loan), and you must continue to make payments until you’ve been notified your deferment has been granted. Otherwise, you could become delinquent or go into default. Forbearance Forbearance is a temporary postponement or reduction of payments for a period of time because you are experiencing financial difficulty. You can receive forbearance if you’re not eligible for a deferment. Unlike deferment, whether your loans are subsidized or unsubsidized, interest accrues, and you’re responsible for repaying it. Your loan holder can grant forbearance in intervals of up to 12 months at a time for up to 3 years. You have to apply to your loan servicer for forbearance, and you must continue to make payments until you've been notified your forbearance has been granted. Other Forms of Payment Relief Although you’re asked to choose a repayment plan when you first begin repayment, you might want to switch repayment plans later if a different plan would work better for your current financial situation. Under the Federal Family Education Loan Program, you can change repayment plans once a year. Under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, you can change plans any time as long as the maximum repayment period under your new plan is longer than the time your Direct Loans have already been in repayment. Default If you default, it means you failed to make payments on your student loan according to the terms of your promissory note, the binding legal document you signed at the time you took out your loan. In other words, you failed to make your loan payments as scheduled. Your school, the financial institution that made or owns your loan, your loan guarantor, and the federal government all can take action to recover the money you owe. Here are some consequences of default: National credit bureaus can be notified of your default, which will harm your credit rating, making it hard to buy a car or a house. You will be ineligible for additional federal student aid if you decide to return to school. Loan payments can be deducted from your paycheck. State and federal income tax refunds can be withheld and applied toward the amount you owe. You will have to pay late fees and collection costs on top of what you already owe. You can be sued. Loan Interest RatesCongress has passed, and the President has signed the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, which ties federal student loan interest rates to financial markets. Under this Act, interest rates will be determined each June for new loans being made for the upcoming award year, which runs from July 1 to the following June 30. Each loan will have a fixed interest rate for the life of the loan. Federal Loan Limits Annual Subsidized Limits 1st Year Undergraduates = $3,500 2nd Year Undergraduates = $4,500 Annual Unsubsidized Limits Dependent undergraduates whose parents can borrow PLUS = $2,000 1st and 2nd-year undergraduate dependent students whose parents cannot borrow PLUS and independent students = $6,000 Remaining undergraduate years for dependent students whose parents cannot borrow PLUS and independent students = $7,000 Aggregate Limits Undergraduate Dependent students = $31,000 (up to $23,000 may be subsidized) Independent students and dependent students whose parents cannot borrow PLUS = $57,500 (up to $23,000 may be subsidized) Apply Now Register Pay for College"

Must maintain a 2.0 grade point average while being a Reconnect participant. F4F/Reconnect/Community College Guarantee and Pell Grant Suppose a student is eligible for a Pell Grant and an F4F/Reconnect or CCLD scholarship. In that case, F4F/Reconnect/CCLD will equal the difference between In-district tuition/mandatory fees and the Pell Grant.  If a student’s Pell Grant covers all In-district tuition and mandatory fees, F4F/Reconnect/CCLD will not be awarded. In this case, F4F/Reconnect student enrollment is reported to the state to satisfy the continuous enrollment requirement.  Please note: other tuition-restricted funds may also affect the F4F/Reconnect/CCLD scholarship award. F4F/Reconnect Leave of Absence Students participating in F4F/Reconnect for at least one semester who cannot maintain continuous enrollment due to hardship may continue to utilize their scholarship for the duration of their four-year program time limit without losing eligibility.  This allowance is called the F4F/Reconnect Leave of Absence. PLEASE NOTE: All students re-admitted to the District after missing two years will be responsible for the curricula and regulations published in the current Catalog and other official publications that are in effect at the time of their re-admission. In certain cases, dates of program admission may take precedence over dates of college admission to meet program requirements for graduation.                                                                                                                                           Process: Students participating in F4F/Reconnect for at least one semester and are experiencing hardship may obtain an F4F/Reconnect Leave of Absence form from the Financial Aid page of the WCCCD website. https://dynamicforms.ngwebsolutions.com/Submit/Start/93b4dbcf-31e4-47fd-8661-99e248af8eec Students will be charged for enrollment if classes are not dropped by the 100% drop date.  Leave of Absence request does not absolve responsibility of charges for enrollment. Leave of Absence requests received after the 100% drop date of the semester will result in the student being financially responsible for that semester’s tuition and fees. Once a Leave of Absence form has been approved, a financial aid administrator will update the student’s account on MISSG within 7-10 business days. Students that submit an F4F/Reconnect Leave of Absence will receive notification of the status of their request through their WCCCD email that the Leave of Absence has been processed, and their account has been updated in MISSG.

If a student's entire schedule is canceled, all tuition and fees associated with canceled sections will be refunded to the student’s account. Activity and registration fees will also be refunded. Drops/WithdrawalsStudents can drop or withdraw from classes until two weeks before finals with an instructor’s signature. However, refunds are issued only for classes officially dropped as follows: 100 percent refund period-First week of classes 50 percent refund period-Second week of classes 0 percent refund period-After second week of classes Check the schedule of classes for semester-specific information. Return of Title IV FundsStudents who withdraw from all of their classes either officially with a grade of W or unofficially with a grade of XW or E before the 60% point in the semester will have their financial aid award adjusted to reflect the percentage of the term completed. This adjustment is called a Return of Title IV Funds (R2T4) and can result in owing a balance to WCCCD and/or the Department of Education. Federal Aid Refund/RepaymentTitle IV Financial Aid funds are awarded to students assuming they will attend school for the entire period for which the assistance is awarded. When a student withdraws, the student may no longer be eligible for the full amount of Title IV Financial Aid funds that the student was originally scheduled to receive. The amount of assistance you’ve earned is determined on a pro-rata basis. That is, if you completed 30 percent of the payment or enrollment period, you earned 30 percent of the assistance you were originally scheduled to receive. R2T4 Calculation ExampleA student is enrolled in a 10-week class and receives $1,000 in Pell Grant funds for the class. At the end of week three, the student withdraws from the class. The student did not earn the entire amount of Pell and must be billed for part of the award. The amount of Pell to be billed is determined by the percentage of class the student completed. In this case, the student will be billed $700 because only 30% of the class was completed. Explanation The student completed 30% of the class: 3 weeks (completed) x 100% = 30% 10 weeks (length of class) The student earned $300 of the Pell award: 30% of $1000 (Pell awarded) = .30 x $1000 = $300. Therefore, the student will be billed $700: Total award – Amount of award earned = Amount of award billed back to student $1000 - $300 = $700 Apply Now Register Pay for College"

Home > Financial Aid > Satisfactory Academic Progress Satisfactory Academic Progress Wayne County Community College District is required to ensure that students complete their academic programs within the maximum time frame and that pace is measured at each evaluation. This requirement is called Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) and will be monitored by the District Financial Aid Office (DFAO). In accordance with federal regulations, the District Financial Aid Office’s policy is to check Satisfactory Academic Progress at the end of each Spring semester for all programs longer than one year and at the end of each semester for all programs one year or less. We then determine the status for the upcoming academic year for the students in programs longer than one year and the status beginning with the next semester for the students in programs of one year or less. The DFAO reviews SAP based on the qualitative and quantitative requirements as established by the U.S. Department of Education.  A student’s progress, including enrollment periods during which no Federal Student Aid was received, is measured quantitatively and qualitatively at each evaluation. Qualitative Measure - Cumulative GPA RequirementStudents must meet the GPA requirement of 1.8 if they attempt 30 credits or less or 2.0 if they attempt more than 30 credits. WCCCD uses a graduated GPA standard Transfer credits do not impact a student’s GPA.  Credits may be transferred from another college. However, no grades are associated with the transferred credits.  Transfer credits are included in the maximum time frame calculation as credits attempted as well as credits earned. The consequences of not meeting the qualitative standards are that the student will be denied financial aid.  The student must submit an appeal along with supporting documentation indicating the reason for poor performance and outlining how the student will improve his/her performance in the future. Students who are not meeting SAP are notified via Web Gate. Quantitative MeasureThe quantitative measure of SAP includes two parts. The first part sets a maximum time frame, measured by attempted credit hours, by which a student must complete an academic program. The second part includes determining whether a student is on pace to complete the academic program within that set maximum time frame. As soon as it becomes apparent a student will be unable to complete their academic program within the maximum time frame, either by falling below the pace standard or when it becomes mathematically impossible to complete their program within the maximum time frame, the student is ineligible for Title IV aid. Maximum Time FrameWCCCD students must complete an undergraduate program of study within 150% of the published length of the educational program. The pace at which a student completes his or her program is calculated by dividing the cumulative hours the student completed by the cumulative hours attempted. Examples: Maximum time frame is 90 credit hours for a 60 credit hour program. If a student completes 67% of all classes attempted, the student should complete the program within the maximum time frame. For a financial aid eligible certificate program that requires 44 credit hours for completion, the maximum time frame would be 66 credits.  Completing 67% of all attempted classes would allow the student to complete within the allowable time frame. The nursing program requires 72 credit hours for successful completion of the program.  For the student to finish within the 150% timeframe, they could attempt no more than 108 credit hours.  Again, the student would need to earn at least 67% of the credits attempted. Part-time attendance counts in the maximum time frame calculation. Attempted hours are counted for all terms, including transfer credits and hours for which the student did not receive financial aid. Withdrawals and Incompletes are also included in the attempted credits to calculate the maximum time frame. A student who is unable to complete the program requirements within the maximum time frame will be denied Title IV aid. A student who exceeds the maximum time frame is ineligible for Title IV aid (although a student may appeal the maximum time frame and may be placed on probation or an academic plan if the appeal is approved). Each academic program is given a maximum time frame based on the number of credit hours required to complete it. Students who are determined to have reached or exceeded the number of credit hours for the maximum time frame would submit an appeal along with an academic plan.  These appeals will be reviewed and evaluated individually to ensure that the student can complete his/her academic program within an acceptable number of credit hours. Pace of ProgressionWCCCD students must earn at least 67% of the credit hours attempted.  If a student earns 67% of all credit hours attempted, the student should complete the program within the maximum time frame.  The pace at which a student completes his or her program is calculated by dividing the cumulative hours the student successfully completed by the cumulative hours attempted. Federal student aid can fund up to 30 credits of combined developmental and ESL courses.Repeated and developmental courses are added to attempted credits and used to calculate attempted credits versus completed credits. Withdrawals and Incompletes are also included in the attempted credits for the calculation of pace. Transfer hours from another school are counted toward a student’s program as both hours attempted and hours completed. The consequences of not meeting the quantitative standards are that the student will be denied financial aid.  The student must submit an appeal along with supporting documentation indicating the reason for poor performance and outlining how the student will improve his/her performance in the future. Students who are not meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress are notified via Web Gate. Financial Aid Disqualification Students who are not making Satisfactory Academic Progress will be placed on financial aid disqualification and will be notified of their financial aid status on Web Gate. Students who are placed on financial aid disqualification will be ineligible to receive federal financial aid for the next semester of enrollment unless they have an approved SAP Appeal. Student may appeal the disqualification of their financial ad by documenting any extenuating and/or mitigating circumstances that may have led to their inability to maintain satisfactory academic progress. Examples of extenuating circumstances include, but are not limited to, 1) the death of a student’s close relative, 2) injury or illness of the student 3) personal tragedy or event.  Students who submit a SAP Appeal are not automatically reinstated for financial aid. AppealsStudents who are identified in the SAP evaluation as not meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress may file an appeal and request consideration for all SAP standards, both qualitative and quantitative. All appeals must be prepared in writing and must include documentation supporting the student’s reason for failure to meet SAP.  An academic plan signed by an advisor that encompasses the remainder of the student’s program must be included. The appeal must incorporate an explanation of why the student failed to meet the SAP requirements and what has changed in their situation that will allow the student to meet the requirements for the next evaluation. Students must provide substantive evidence of their extenuating circumstances as supporting documentation with their appeals. No written statements explaining circumstances will be accepted. The SAP Appeal Form is available through Web Gate on Student Requirements for students who are eligible to submit an appeal. Students are advised to include all pertinent information with their initial appeal; however, if their appeal is denied and they feel they have additional information that could influence a positive outcome, they are permitted to resubmit the appeal. All SAP appeals will be reviewed by the WCCCD Financial Aid Office. All decisions are final.  Notification of the appeal decision will be updated on Web Gate. Appeal Decisions Probation — One-semester eligibility. Students must be able to meet SAP standards within the given semester of eligibility. Academic Plan — Academic Year eligibility. Students must adhere to the academic plan approved during the appeal process. Failure to do so may result in termination of financial aid eligibility. Students must submit an appeal if they want to change their academic plan. Termination — Financial aid eligibility is terminated for students who do not meet the SAP standards or have acceptable extenuating circumstances. Under certain circumstances, students may be eligible to appeal this termination decision during the following semester. Failure to meet the conditions of probation or academic plan may result in the termination of the student’s financial aid eligibility. If a student is approved for any Academic Plan, Probation or is enrolled in a certificate program of 1 year or less, Satisfactory Academic Progress will be monitored after grades are posted every semester. In some cases, financial aid eligibility may be terminated due to failure to meet the guidelines for SAP after a book voucher or award has been posted for the upcoming semester. If students fail to meet SAP standards for the upcoming semester, they will be responsible for any charges incurred, such as tuition and fees for the upcoming semester and use of the book voucher. Reinstatement of financial aid is dependent upon professional judgment and other factors.  The following “special circumstances” will be considered when processing an appeal: documentation of a significant medical illness or injury; documentation of a death of a close relative; documentation of another significant event or personal tragedy; documentation of a change in academic program. In accordance with federal regulations, change of academic program will be allowed no more than twice. Regaining EligibilityOther than when an appeal is granted, a student can regain eligibility only by taking action that brings him/her into compliance with the qualitative and quantitative components of WCCCD’s academic progress standard. A student may take classes at his/her own expense and achieve grades and completion rates that bring him/her back into compliance with SAP requirements.  When the SAP evaluation is performed, if that student is once again meeting SAP standards his/her financial aid will be reinstated for future semesters. Previously terminated students are given the opportunity to appeal on a case-by-case basis. Students who lose their financial aid eligibility because they fail to meet satisfactory academic progress will regain eligibility when it is determined that they are again meeting both the qualitative and quantitative standards. They are responsible for the payment of tuition and fees until financial aid eligibility is regained. When satisfactory academic progress standards are met, eligibility is regained for subsequent terms of enrollment. Students are notified of their eligibility via Web Gate. Treatment of Repeated Courses, Audited Courses, Withdrawals, Incompletes &Grade Changes Financial aid funds may not be used to cover the cost of non-credit courses,therefore they are not counted as credit hours attempted. Withdrawal grades (W, XW and unearned E) and incomplete grades (I) will be counted as credit hours attempted. Repeated and developmental courses are added into credits attempted and are used in the calculation of attempted credits versus completed credits. Up to 30 credits of combined developmental and ESL courses can be fundedwith Federal Student Aid. Upon notification of an official grade change by the student or other school official, the DFAO will re-assess the student’s SAP status as needed. College policy requires all students who earn an incomplete “I” grade to complete that course by the end of two consecutive terms after the term in which the “I” grade was given.  Failure to complete the course requirements within the two-consecutive-term time limit shall result in a grade of “E” replacing the “I” grade. Audit courses are not eligible for financial aid. Therefore, they are not included in attempted or credits. Treatment of Consortium, Change of Major, Second Degree, & Second Major Courses WCCCD does participate in consortium agreements.  The Financial Aid Office agrees to forward the student’s grades to the home school that the student is attending.  The Financial Aid Office also agrees that the home school will award and disburse the financial aid earned by the student.  The student must then compensate WCCCD for any courses taken here. Students seeking a second Associate’s Degree or certificate who are not meeting the quantitative standard of 150% would need to submit an appeal (please refer to the Appeal Process) to have reinstatement of eligibility considered. Successfully completed credits that apply to the second degree will be considered in the appeal review. WCCCD does not authorize financial aid eligibility for students who have earned at least 2 degrees or any combination of certificates that equals the equivalent (i.e., 1 degree + 2 certificates = 2 degrees; 4 certificates = 2 degrees) Completion of Degree Requirements A student who completes the academic requirements for a program but does not yet have the degree or certificate is not eligible for additional FSA funds for that program.

Home > Financial Aid > Financial Aid Eligibility Financial Aid Eligibility To qualify for federal student aid, you generally need to meet the following criteria: Financial Need: Most aid programs require financial need, so it’s important to apply for financial aid by the priority deadlines. Education Level: You must have one of the following: A high school diploma A GED certificate Completed secondary-level homeschooling in line with your state's laws Enrollment Status: You should be enrolled or accepted for enrollment in an eligible degree or certificate program. Only courses required for your declared program will count toward your aid eligibility. Citizenship: You must be a U.S. citizen or an eligible non-citizen. Academic Progress: Continuing students must meet satisfactory academic progress standards. Educational Purpose: Federal student aid must be used only for educational expenses. Loan and Grant Status: You need to certify that you are not in default on any federal student loans and that you do not owe money on federal student grants. Note for Guest Students: If you are a guest student wanting to take classes at WCCCD, you can only receive financial aid if your home school has a consortium agreement with WCCCD. Check with your home school for details. Repeat Course Policy for Financial Aid Federal regulations require us to monitor your enrollment for Title IV aid when you repeat courses. Here’s what you need to know: You can retake a course if you fail it and receive financial aid for that. If you passed a course (with a grade of D or better), you can only receive financial aid for that course one more time. Important Notes: Once you’ve attempted a course twice with a passing grade, you won’t be eligible for financial aid for that course again, regardless of the outcome. This policy is separate from WCCCD’s academic policies on repeating courses, so be sure to check both! If you have any questions about your eligibility or the repeat course policy, don’t hesitate to reach out to the Financial Aid Office for assistance. Apply Now Register Pay for College"

It is part of Wayne County Community College District's mission to make college affordable and accessible to everyone. Applying for Financial Aid The first step to getting financial aid is to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Apply today. Your contributor(s) must also provide information and sign if you are a dependent student. Filling Out Your FAFSA The FAFSA is available online as early as October 1st unless otherwise notified by the U.S. Department of Education. To complete the FAFSA to apply for aid, follow these steps: Complete all sections about yourself and contributor(s) if you are dependent, your school plans, and your (and your contributors’) financial information. Indicate WCCCD using our school code: 009230. Provide your electronic signature (PIN). You must set up your PIN during the FAFSA application process. If you are a dependent student, remember to include your parent's (known as the Contributor) PIN, or your FAFSA will be rejected. The student and all contributors must consent to allowing access to FTI (Federal Tax Information) on the FAFSA or the FAFSA will be rejected and the student will not be eligible to receive federal student aid. Submit your information. Print out and keep a copy of your submitted information for your records. What Happens Next After filling out your FAFSA you will receive two things: The U.S. Department of Education will email you a FAFSA Submission Summary (FSS). Read your FSS thoroughly, check it for accuracy, and follow up on any requests for additional information. Your Student Aid Index (SAI) is calculated from the information you provided on the FAFSA and is listed on your FSS. The SAI is a formula-based index number ranging from –1500 to 999999. Where your SAI falls within the SAI range helps the District Financial Aid Office determine how much financial support you will need. If you have special or unusual circumstances that may impact your dependency status or SAI, you may notify the District Financial Aid Office by completing the Special Circumstance or Unusual Circumstance forms on the WCCCD Student Forms portal. If the U.S. Department of Education selects your FAFSA for a process called verification, you will need to submit additional information to WCCCD. Check WEB GATE and WCCCD Student Forms for your financial aid requirements status. Be sure to check Web Gate, WCCCD Student Forms, and your email often for updates.

To simplify the process, we compiled answers to frequently asked questions about financial aid. Please review these and call us if you have additional questions. Answers to Your Questions What is a financial need? Financial need is the difference between what it costs to attend WCCCD and what you and your family are expected to contribute toward your college expenses (based on the FAFSA information). In other words, Cost of Attendance - Student Aid Index = Financial Need. Many types of financial aid can be applied only toward the demonstrated financial need. However, there are other types of aid that can be awarded regardless of your need. Who is eligible? While each aid program has special requirements, you are generally eligible for financial assistance if you meet the following requirements. You must: Have a financial need (except for some loan programs and many scholarship programs). Students are encouraged to apply for financial aid by the priority deadlines; Have a high school diploma, a General Education Development (GED) certificate, completed homeschooling at the secondary level as defined by state law, or completed one of the ability-to-benefit (ATB) alternatives and enrolled in an eligible postsecondary program before July 1, 2012. Be enrolled or accepted for enrollment as a student working toward a degree or certificate in an eligible program; Be a U.S. citizen or eligible non-U.S. citizen; Have a valid Social Security Number; Meet Satisfactory Academic Progress (continuing students only); Use the Federal Student Aid only for educational purposes and for more information about Federal Aid eligibility, see the U.S. Department of Education's Student Guide. https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements How will my contribution be determined? Parent Contribution: Annual income is not the only factor considered in evaluating the parent contribution. Your parent's age(s), assets, household size, and the number of family members in college are also considered.Student Contribution: You are expected to contribute a portion of your after-tax income toward your annual educational expenses. A portion of your savings and other assets are also considered. What is my dependency status? A student is considered independent for financial aid purposes if he or she is 24 years of age or older by December 31 of the award year, or if he or she: Is an orphan or ward of the court, or was a ward of the court until age 18 Is a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, or on active duty Is married Has legal dependents other than a spouse Unaccompanied Homeless Youth In a legal guardianship until age 18 If a student does not meet at least one of these criteria, he or she is considered dependent for financial aid purposes and parent financial information must be included on the FAFSA. How do I apply for financial aid? Complete a Federal Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). You may complete the FAFSA application online, our Federal School Code must be listed: 009230 Do I have to re-apply every year? In order to receive financial aid, you must file a FAFSA each year and it can be done as early as December 1st. How can I view my financial aid award and document requirements? All award information and list of required documents are located on Web Gate. You may access your Web Gate account at www.wcccd.edu. We suggest that you review your Web Gate account frequently for updates. Can I get aid for the summer semester? Students requesting Summer Pell Grant funds must fill out the Summer Pell Grant application on our website unless you attended WCCCD for both Fall and Spring semester. If you attended WCCCD for both Fall and Spring semester, your summer award (if applicable) will be awarded automatically and there is no need to fill out a Summer Pell Grant application. Students requesting Summer Loans or Work Study must submit the appropriate application to the District Financial Aid Office through Online Forms. Should I send in my tax forms and other paperwork before you ask for it? You should not submit tax forms and/or other paperwork unless we specifically ask for these documents since they may not be required. What are the qualifications to receive a student loan? You must be enrolled at least half time in courses that count toward an eligible degree or certificate program each semester (6 credit hours) You must complete entrance counseling if you are a first time borrower and a Master Promissory Note (MPN) (once every 10 years) at https://studentloans.gov/ No default or over-award status on prior loans or federal aid You must meet standards of Satisfactory Academic Progress Remember! All loans must be repaid. View repayment options at https://studentloans.gov/ All loan requests will be reviewed on an individual basis When will I receive my refund? The Bursar’s Office is responsible for disbursement of funds and determines the amount of refund, if any, or balance owed. You may track your refund by logging on to RefundSelection.com. What is Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)? Satisfactory Academic Progress is the term used to denote a student’s successful completion of coursework toward a certificate or degree. Federal regulations require that all students make continued progress toward an educational goal. The Federal Government has established the following Standards for Satisfactory Academic Progress: What are my quantitative requirements? Completing a program of study within 150% of the credits required to graduate. [ If a major requires 60 credit hours for graduation, a student must complete the program in no more than 90 credit hours.] Successfully completing at least 67% of all attempted credits. [A student must receive a passing grade in at least 2 out of every 3 classes in which he or she is enrolled. ] Non-credit courses are not included in the calculation of financial aid, and are therefore not counted as credit hours attempted. Transfer credit, remedial and repeated courses will be counted as credit hours attempted. Withdrawal grades (with the exception of institutional withdrawal), and incomplete grades will be counted as attempted hours. Repeated and developmental courses are added into credits attempted and are used in the calculation of attempted credits verses completed credits. Up to 30 credits of combined developmental and ESL courses can be funded with federal student aid. Students seeking a second Associate’s Degree, who are not meeting the quantitative standard of 150%, would need to submit an appeal (please refer to the Appeal Process below) in order to have reinstatement of eligibility considered. Successfully completed credits that apply to the second degree will be considered in the appeal review. What are my qualitative requirements? The District Financial Aid Office will review the qualitative progress after each academic year. In order to maintain eligibility a student must: Maintain at least a cumulative 2.0 grade point average.[A student must maintain at least a “C” average ] NotificationStudents who fail either the quantitative or qualitative test for academic progress will be notified in writing that further financial aid is denied. If you have experienced a significant circumstance which you feel has had an impact on your ability to make Satisfactory Academic Progress, you have the opportunity to file an appeal with the District Financial Aid Office. Appeals that do not include proper documentation are considered incomplete and will be denied. All appeals must contain substantive evidence as supporting documentation. Written Statements will not be accepted as supporting documentation. What is considered a significant circumstance? Medical/illness in immediate family Domestic/family issues/marital issues Loss of employment Second academic degree What is considered acceptable documentation? Statement from doctor Obituary or funeral program/Death Certificate Police report or social agency report Termination or layoff notice Social services or court documents Legal documentation Copy or proof of first academic degree Apply Now Register Pay for College"

Work-Study Hiring Process Work-Study Jobs Work-Study Forms Work-Study FAQs Where is the Federal Work-Study Placement Office located? The Federal Work-Study Placement Office is located in the Division of District Student Services at 801 W. Fort Street in Detroit, Michigan. Hours of operation are Monday through Friday 9am to 5pm. To connect with a representative, send an email to: wsp@wcccd.edu. Am I guaranteed the Federal Work-Study money that is listed on my Financial Aid Award letter? Yes. The dollar amount listed on the FWS student’s Web-Gate account represents the amount of funds available for you to earn. FWS students cannot surpass this earning limit for the academic year. FWS students need to work with their supervisor to schedule enough hours to reach their maximum earnings. The maximum number of hours a FWS student can work is 29 hours per week. FWS awards are subject to change based upon the student’s eligibility. What is the \"earnings limit\"? The earnings limit is the maximum amount that the FWS student may earn during the academic year. The supervisor and student should compute how many hours a FWS student is able to work at their wage rate to determine the FWS student's schedule for the year. Any funds not earned at the end of the academic year will be forfeited and do not carry over to the next year. FWS students should be aware that their earnings limit might decrease during the academic year as a result of the receipt of outside resources (e.g., scholarships). If family circumstances change, increases to the earnings limit may be made. The FWS student will be notified if an award is adjusted. What if I do not accept a Federal Work-Study job as part of the financial aid package? Students have a choice of accepting or denying the FWS funds. I declined my Federal Work-Study and then found a FWS job I really like. Can I have my award back? Students may request to have FWS funds re-awarded in writing to wsp@wcccd.edu. Funds run out quickly considering the high demand for FWS assistance; if funds are available, it is possible that the student can receive the funds.  However, if not, the student will be placed on a waiting list and will be contacted by the FWS Placement Office once funds are available. If I decline my Federal Work-Study for this year, will it affect my allotment for next year? Federal Work-Study is a federal need-based program. Students are welcome to request FWS any year as long as they meet the eligibility requirements. Can I decline my FWS for one semester only? Yes, you can decline or request a reduction in your Federal Work-Study for any one term or for all of them, however, you must state in writing that you are rejecting or reducing your funds in order for your request to be made official. What are the basic requirements to be eligible for Federal Work-Study? Students must have financial need as determined on the FAFSA, meet satisfactory academic progress requirements and be enrolled for at least 6 credits (that are eligible toward your declared degree or certificate program) that count toward an eligible major to qualify for FWS. If I have a Federal Work-Study job, will the earnings from a non-Federal Work-Study job be monitored? The answer is no. However, if a FWS student has significant non-FWS earnings, they may effect your aid eligibility for the next academic year. How do I go about finding a Federal Work-Study job? Once the student has applied for financial aid for the current academic year and selected that they are interested in receiving Federal Work-Study funds, eligible students will be awarded. The District Financial Aid Office will award eligible students. The Federal Work-Study Placement Office will contact the student letting them know they have been awarded Federal Work-Study. The Federal Work-Study Placement Office will contact each student by phone or email with further instructions. The Federal Work-Study Placement Office will then start processing all paperwork once everything is completed and received,and mandatory orientation has been completed. The student will be placed at a campus or off-site. If a student is returning and wishes to report back to their previous location, the supervisor will sign the authorization form requesting the FWS student to return and the Federal Work-Study Placement Office will place the student in the requested location. What should I do once I am hired? All students must have the supervisor fill out a Federal Work-Study authorization form. This form can be obtained from the Federal Work-Study website. FWS students are not authorized to work and will not be issued paychecks until all of the necessary forms are completed. Students may not report to work until they have received an email with their official start date. Can I work more than one Federal Work-Study position? Federal Work-Study students are only allowed to work at one location per semester. May I work during vacations/breaks? FWS Students are allowed to work while classes are in session only. Some exceptions may apply with prior approval from DFAO. Is work available over the summer? Summer jobs are available on and off campus if funds are available. FWS Students must attend the mandatory orientation, and complete the FWS packet process as stated on question 12. How do I get paid? Paychecks are issued on a bi-weekly basis for the previous two weeks of work. Paychecks can either be directly deposited into the student's checking account, Bank Mobile account or mailed to the home address. All paychecks are viewable on Web-Gate. Why didn't I get paid? Perhaps you entered your hours incorrectly or were late submitting your hours before the cut-off date or time. If so, contact your supervisor or the Federal Work-Study Placement Office. Late timesheets will be processed during the next pay period. What should I do if I change my address? To change your address for Payroll, go to the Student Services Department at your campus with your current identification and address, ask for a change of data form and submit. A copy of your identification will be copied and the change will be made by the representative at that location. Can I deposit my Federal Work-Study paycheck directly into my account? Yes, you have the option to sign up for direct deposit when you get hired. Will I be taxed on my earnings? Yes, income earned through the Federal Work-Study Program is taxable. Therefore, each FWS student must complete city, state and federal withholding forms and include their earnings on appropriate tax returns. Who should I contact if I have additional questions about the Federal Work-Study Program?

What’s the Job Outlook for Library Technicians and Library Assistants? Employment of library technicians and assistants is projected to decline 3 percent from 2018 to 2028, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Libraries will use these workers to take over some of the duties of librarians, whose hourly wages are usually higher.

A certificate in library technology from WCCCD requires 33 credits to complete. As a library technology student at WCCCD, you’ll take both general education courses and courses required for a library technology major. Some students plan to matriculate to an associate program to then transfer to a four-year college or university after earning their AAS. If that’s your goal, you might choose specific courses. Talk with your advisor about a personalized plan that meets your goals. How Long Does it Take to Earn a Library Technology Certificate? Most library technology students take three semesters (1.5 years) to complete certificate prerequisites and required courses. What Will I Learn as a Library Technology Student? WCCCD library technology students learn to oversee the daily operations of a library department and perform specific duties such as acquisitions, cataloging, circulation services, interlibrary loans, periodicals maintenance, children's services, government documents maintenance, special collections work, etc. Courses cover a wide range of topics, including liberal arts and other library-technology-focused disciplines.

    "content": "Blackboard Orientation Weather Closure - 1.20.26 Due to inclement weather, all WCCCD buildings will be closed today, Tuesday, January 20, 2026. Online classes will meet. Home > Blackboard Orientation Blackboard Orientation In this orientation, you will understand the basics of using Blackboard for your online classes.This online orientation will take approximately 45 minutes. There are seven modules, short video clips, and a quiz that you must complete with 80% or better to pass the orientation. You will be able to print proof of successful completion at the end of this orientation. There are two ways to access Blackboard: through the college’s website or a direct website address (URL): blackboard.wcccd.edu. Go to www.wcccd.edu. From the global navigation, you will always find a link to Blackboard under Student Resources. You can access This login page directly by entering blackboard.wcccd.edu in the address bar on your browser. Your Username is your “A” number (Axxxxxxxx), and your password (mmddyy) is the same password you use for Web-Gate. If you change your password for Web-Gate, then your password will change in Blackboard to the new password. You cannot access your online classes until the official first day of classes. Make sure you check your schedule for the start date and end date of classes. Getting Started Once you log on, a grayed-out screen may pop up if you are a first-time user of Blackboard.  This screen allows you to personalize your Blackboard account, much like other social media tools, but you are not required to.  You can add a profile picture, which should be professional since this is an image that your peers and instructors see.  Personalizing your account is up to you.  You do not have to make any changes if you prefer, or you can choose to personalize later. A white message box pops up that says, “Please Read this Message.” It asks you to accept cookies on your device, which you must either Decline or Agree to and Continue. You must click “Agree & Continue” to access Blackboard. The Base Navigation left-hand menu is the first thing you will see after successfully signing into Blackboard.  Two key items you will want to pay attention to: *Activity Stream: links the announcements posted in your classes.*Courses: list the online courses you are enrolled in for the semester. Click on the course name to access that course in Blackboard. Note: If you do not see all of the courses you registered for listed, you should check the start dates in Web Gate. Submitting Assignments Taking a Test or Quiz Grades Course Menu Once you have entered a Blackboard course, you will see a list of links down the left-hand side of the screen. This is known as the Course Menu. This menu may vary regarding the options or buttons your instructor has decided to include.  For example, your syllabus may be under “Syllabus” or “Course Information,” and some courses may not even have a “Syllabus” button to click on. Note:  Your syllabus is an important document that outlines the codes of conduct, schedule, and instructor contact information you need to know for each class.  It is recommended you print out your syllabus so you can refer to it outside of Blackboard. Look out for important information, such as announcements (due date extensions, new information posted, etc.), the syllabus, the instructor’s contact information, course documents/readings, the discussion board, quizzes, tests, and assignments. There are multiple ways to locate all of these. Note: The course menu may be different for each class. However, you should click on every button to familiarize yourself with the information in each menu item. Getting Help When an issue occurs in your course, you should contact your instructor first. Issues may include you cannot post to the discussion board, problems with submitting an assignment, or being locked out of a quiz or test before completing the assignment. If you do not receive a response from your instructor within 48 hours, you should contact distancelearning@wcccd.edu for help with resolving the issue. Within your Blackboard course site is “Help” which contains solutions to many student issues. Discussion Forum Apply Now Register Pay for College"

The Summit will be hosted by WCCCD Chancellor Dr. Curtis L. Ivery at the redesigned WCCCD Culinary Arts & Banquet Center at the Denise Wellons-Glover Welcome Center on the Northwest Campus, located at 8200 West Outer Drive in Detroit. Youth Mental Health, Substance Abuse, and Rebuilding Communities and Lives is the first series of summits convened by WCCCD Chancellor Dr. Curtis L. Ivery focusing on the complex social, educational, and mental health issues that impact the success and vitality of young people across the nation. This is the first of a series of national youth conferences, part of WCCCD’s Urban Summit Series, that examines these issues through the lens of our younger generations, and the unique solutions that may be brought to bear. “Our mission has always been to provide pathways to better lives through higher education,” said WCCCD Chancellor Dr. Curtis L. Ivery. “Providing forums that build broader understanding of the barriers that our young people face in growing to their full potential is critical to building a national dialogue of how we can remove those barriers and pull together to thrive in a new era with a range of pressures older generations did not experience in the same way.” Featured speakers and panelists include Resilience Expert and New York Times Bestselling author Shaka Senghor, Detroit Pistons Shooting Guard Chaz Lanier, President of the NAACP Detroit Branch Rev. Dr. Wendell Anthony, DPSCD Superintendent Dr. Nikolai Vitti, Bankole Thompson, and James White, President and CEO of Detroit Wayne Integrated Health Network (DWIHN).

Online classes will meet. Home > District News > Rebuilding dental care from within: How local students are strengthening the oral health safety net Rebuilding dental care from within: How local students are strengthening the oral health safety net When Dr. Abby Freeman asks college students from underserved communities why they are pursuing a career in oral health, she hears similar stories.Students at Wayne County Community College District, where Freeman is district provost for health sciences, often share that they and their family have struggled to access dental care – something they hope to change for future generations.“Many students want to serve the communities they grew up in, particularly in neighborhoods with poor access to dental care,” she said. “When local students from underrepresented communities are trained and employed in oral health professions, they are more likely to remain in and serve those communities. This creates a cycle of reinvestment in health, education and economic development.”The students and the Detroit-based college are working to rebuild the country’s fraying oral health safety net – the clinics, providers and public programs that deliver dental care to those who need it most.But challenges in funding and staffing – particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic – have made it difficult for systems to keep up. And solving the problem not only means improving access to dental care, but also making sure the workforce reflects the demographics of the communities they serve.“Across metro Detroit, we tend to see deep racial, ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes, including oral health, for a variety of reasons that are difficult to impact like lack of dental insurance and affordability or a lack of trust in the health care system or providers,” Freeman said. “In communities where residents have historically experienced health care neglect, seeing providers who share their cultural background can significantly increase trust in care.”Patients who trust their providers are more likely to seek preventive services, follow treatment recommendations and return for appointments.Compared to the U.S. population, Black and Hispanic dentists remain underrepresented in the workforce, according to the American Dental Association. There’s also a wide disparity of access to dental services between urban and rural areas, with the dentist-to-population ratio in rural areas having declined steadily for the past decade.But expanding access to care isn’t just about opening more clinics – it’s also about building teams who care deeply about patients, said Ryan Torresan, an editorial board member of the industry publication “Group Dentistry Now.” \"A dental office is not just a place of care — it’s a pillar of the community,” he said. “The greatest impact comes when practices see themselves as part of the social fabric, serving not only those with easy access, but also those on the margins — the uninsured, the elderly, the rural and the vulnerable.”Like many dental programs and clinics, safety net dental programs and clinics are experiencing difficulties recruiting and retaining dental professionals, said Candace Hsu Owen, senior director of education and strategic partnerships at the National Network for Oral Health Access, which serves the largest group of safety-net oral practitioners in the country.Workforce diversity is critical for strengthening the oral health safety net – and improving health outcomes.“There is research that shows that people have improved health outcomes and health care experiences if they receive care from people that look like them,” she said. “The safety net demonstrates that by having a diverse workforce that is culturally responsive to its patients. Many individuals working in the safety net come from that community and may share the same language and culture.”Experts agree that repairing the safety net requires investing in education and making dental careers accessible, especially for a diverse student population.“A lot of the barriers in the dental workforce for representation and diversity comes from the academic level,” Owen said. “There is a lot of gatekeeping that happens in higher education, especially in health professions. Allocating resources towards recruiting a diverse student population will support a future dental workforce that is representative of the population. Additionally, it’s critical that dental education programs commit to integrating social mission into their curriculum. This will create a workforce that is more culturally responsive.”At WCCCD, the No. 1 challenge that students from underserved communities face is financial, Freeman said. They also may lack rigorous science and math preparation, which are foundational for oral health programs.To combat that, WCCCD provides access to scholarships and grants and offers one-on-one advisory programs specially designed for students in health science programs. It offers dual-enrollment partnerships with Detroit-area schools, and it partners with K-12 schools to introduce students from diverse backgrounds to oral health careers early on.“There is often a lack of exposure to oral health careers in communities with limited access to dental care or role models in the profession,” Freeman said. “If you don’t see these professions in your life, in your community, it’s harder to know that is an option for you.” By Michelle Fitzgerald, Crain’s Content Studio Crain's Detroit Business Date Posted August 25, 2025 Categories Article, Homepage Related News ALL-USA Academic Team Program Scholarship Opportunity Applications are now being accepted for the 2025-2026 ALL-USA Academic Team Program, generously sponsored by Cengage, The Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation, The Coca-Cola Foundation, AACC, and Phi Theta Kappa.

Home > District News > 2025 Annual Rainbow PUSH/CEF Global Automotive Summit: Diversity at the Heart of Innovation and Growth 2025 Annual Rainbow PUSH/CEF Global Automotive Summit: Diversity at the Heart of Innovation and Growth By Jeremy Allen, Executive Editor, Chicago Defender | Published Oct. 14, 2025 Read the original article in the Chicago Defender here. As the automotive industry faces unprecedented challenges and transformative change, the 2025 Annual Rainbow PUSH/CEF Global Automotive Summit returns to Detroit with a renewed focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. This year marks the 26th anniversary of the event, a gathering that has long been recognized as a critical platform for advancing diverse supply chains and strengthening minority dealership networks within the global automotive sector. On Oct. 15, 2025, leaders from across the industry will converge at the Motor City Casino Hotel & Conference Center in Detroit for a day of insightful discussions, strategy sessions, and collaborative networking opportunities. From 8:15 a.m. to 2:45 p.m., stakeholders representing automakers, suppliers, dealerships, and industry experts will share their perspectives on key trends shaping the future of the automotive landscape. In the context of an evolving global economy, the summit offers an opportunity for organizations to align on actionable strategies for fostering inclusive growth. This year’s summit brings together a lineup of sessions aimed at tackling the most pressing issues facing the industry today. One of the morning’s key sessions, “State of the Automotive Industry,” will set the tone for the event, offering an overview of both current challenges and opportunities for automakers and their supply chain partners. This session will provide attendees with insights into the evolving market conditions that are influencing business decisions at all levels. A particularly notable session will be focused on minority dealerships. Perry Watson IV, president of the National Association of Minority Automotive Dealers (NAMAD), will lead a discussion on the ongoing efforts to increase the number of minority-owned dealerships and the impact this growth has on the industry. As diversity within dealership networks becomes more critical, Watson’s session is expected to delve into the tangible benefits of expanding these networks — not only for the bottom line but for the communities they serve. In another segment, “Ethnic Minorities and Vehicle Purchases,” Marc Bland, chief diversity officer at S&P Global Mobility, will present data-driven insights on consumer purchasing trends. With ethnic minorities representing an increasingly significant portion of the automotive consumer base, Bland’s discussion will examine how automakers can better connect with these key demographics and what steps must be taken to ensure that vehicle offerings reflect the diverse needs of the market. At 10:15 a.m., a panel on “Strengthening Supplier Partnerships” will explore the strategies needed to build stronger, more resilient partnerships between automotive manufacturers and their suppliers. With the industry’s shift toward electrification, sustainability, and innovative technologies, establishing these robust partnerships is more important than ever. Panelists include Ryan Grimm, group vice president of Purchasing & Supplier Development at Toyota Motor North America, and Marvin Washington, vice president of Global Purchasing & Supply Chain Management at Stellantis North America. Together, they will provide attendees with a roadmap for fostering innovation and driving shared success in a rapidly changing global landscape. The lunch keynote will feature a fireside chat with Elizabeth Krear, president and CEO of the Center for Automotive Research. As an influential leader in automotive research, Krear’s conversation will center on the industry’s evolving workforce and the critical role that diversity and innovation play in shaping its future. As the sector continues to embrace new technologies, Krear’s insights will help attendees understand how investing in diverse talent pipelines will be essential for ensuring long-term growth. The afternoon session, “Developing Tomorrow’s Workforce,” will focus on addressing the industry’s ongoing talent gap. With a particular emphasis on the need for skilled engineers and repair technicians, this panel will discuss the growing challenges that automotive employers face when trying to build a qualified workforce. The conversation will center on how educational institutions, training programs, and the automotive industry can collaborate to create a more inclusive, highly skilled workforce capable of meeting the demands of tomorrow. One of the summit’s most anticipated moments will be the unveiling of the 2025 Brand Equity Index, a revamped version of the Automotive Diversity Scorecard that has been a hallmark of the event since 2012. This revised index, developed in partnership with S&P Global, will provide an updated look at multicultural and non-multicultural consumer volumes, gender distributions, and dealer information provided by NAMAD. As the industry continues its efforts to build a more equitable and inclusive ecosystem, the Brand Equity Index has been a powerful tool for tracking progress and highlighting areas that need further attention from automotive manufacturers.

Home > District News > He thought he'd be a short-timer, 30 years later Wayne County educator is still here He thought he'd be a short-timer, 30 years later Wayne County educator is still here Georgea Kovanis Detroit Free Press | Updated Aug. 10, 2025, 7:59 a.m. ET To read the original article in the Detroit Free Press visit: Longtime community college educator wins Shining Light award Maybe, Curtis Ivery thinks, growing up in segregated Amarillo, Texas, where he saw so many people like him — poor, Black — passed over, is the reason he has spent his adult life working in education, helping children, adults, and families reach their potential. “I became a very giving person,” Ivery, who is 76, said recently. “I just never allowed myself to do anything other than care for people. … I just always said if I ever had an opportunity to be in a leadership role, I’d do everything I could to make sure people would be OK.” For the past 30 years, Ivery — a husband, a father, a grandfather, author on topics such as fatherhood, leadership and education — has been doing that at the Wayne County Community College District, where he is chancellor of the sprawling six-campus education system that covers Detroit and all of Wayne County. And because of those works, he is the recipient of the 2025 Neal Shine Award for Exemplary Regional Leadership, part of the Shining Light Awards, presented annually by the Metropolitan Affairs Coalition and the Detroit Free Press. Shine, the beloved and respected editor and publisher of the Detroit Free Press, died in 2007, leaving behind a legacy of cooperation and unity as a booster of Detroit, the metro area, and the people who inhabit it. “Dr. Ivery has moved the Wayne County Community College … to a level that was heretofore unseen,” said the Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the Detroit Branch of the NAACP, pastor of Fellowship Chapel in Detroit, and a fan of Ivery’s work at the once-troubled community college. “He came to the college at a time when people were saying, ‘Close the doors, turn the lights off!’ … He's moved to make certain that the campus is on solid financial grounds. … In addition to that, he’s just a nice guy. He loves the college, he supports the people, and he’s a community person.” Football was Ivery's ticket out of Amarillo. He won a scholarship to Texas A&M-Kingsville (then Texas A&I), though his career on the field didn’t last long. “After the first year, that was it for football,” he said. He found other pursuits, academic and beyond, more interesting. “I got smarter,” he said. “I became president of the African American Society. … I was the first Black to be elected president of the student body. I got involved in a lot of things that enlightened me.” After undergrad, Ivery applied to Harvard Law School, but never heard back. He did graduate work at West Texas State and received his doctorate in higher education administration from the University of Arkansas. In addition to education posts, Ivery served as head of the human services department for the state of Arkansas, becoming the first African American ever to be appointed to a governor’s cabinet—under then-Governor Bill Clinton. Wayne County Community College was in tumult when Ivery arrived from Texas’ Mountain View College (part of the Dallas County Community College District) in 1995, marked by infighting among board members and a revolving door of administrators—three presidents in five years—and a less-than-great reputation. “My colleagues thought I’d lost my mind,” Ivery said. Then again, he added, “I’ve always been a fighter and I love a challenge and, boy, did I have one.” He figured he would stay a couple of years before moving on to another job. But he never left—and has no plans to do so. Under his tenure as chancellor, WCCCD has expanded its footprint, improved facilities, and updated its course offerings. About 12,000 students enroll in degree programs for the fall and spring semesters. About 40,000 enroll in non-degree programs, including vocational programs, each year. “I was walking down the hallway at one of the campuses and one of the students stopped me as they were coming out of the classroom, and I thought they were going to complain,” Ivery recalled. “He said, ‘We love you. … We just love the furniture in the classroom, we love the smell of fresh paint in the rooms, the computers and everything.’ We had just passed the millage and bought a lot of things for the classroom. … It was as simple as having nice furniture in the classroom and the walls painted.” And once students feel welcomed and valued, they can get to the business of learning. “I always thought that community colleges were better than universities,” Ivery said. “I think we’re committed to teaching. We’re not research-oriented; we don’t use teaching assistants in the classroom. We have teachers who are so legitimately committed to pedagogy and learning outcomes and students move to the next level.” It's education that teaches people to think critically, to process information. And, Ivery says, with that “somehow you begin to think in ways that teach you love and passion for people.” The Detroit Free Press and Metropolitan Affairs Coalition’s Shining Light Award highlights the importance of regional leadership and cooperation to the success of southeast Michigan, honoring leaders whose work crosses geographic, institutional or cultural boundaries.

It applies to all devices and media that fall into the following categories: Laptop/notebook Tablet computers (e.g., iPads) Mobile/cellular phones Smartphones PDAs Any mobile device capable of storing District data and connecting to an unmanaged network This policy aims to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data within WCCCD’s technology infrastructure. It aims to prevent data from being deliberately or inadvertently stored insecurely on mobile devices or transmitted over insecure networks where it could be compromised. Such breaches could lead to information loss, damage to critical applications, financial loss, and harm to the District’s public image. All users utilizing mobile devices to back up, store, or access District data on external networks must adhere to WCCCD-defined processes. Applicability This policy applies to all WCCCD employees, including full-time and part-time staff, contractors, faculty, and agents who use either WCCCD-owned or personally-owned mobile devices to access, store, or back up any District resources or information. Access to District resources is a privilege, not a right; therefore, employment at WCCCD does not guarantee the ability to use these devices to access District networks and information. Policy and Appropriate Use Employees using mobile devices to access District resources are responsible for ensuring that all security protocols used for conventional storage infrastructure are also applied to mobile devices. Any mobile device used for WCCCD business must be operated appropriately, responsibly, and ethically. Failure to comply may result in the immediate suspension of the user’s account. Rules to Observe Access Control IT reserves the right to refuse, by physical and non-physical means, the ability to connect mobile devices to District and District-connected infrastructure. IT will engage in such action if it feels such equipment is being used in such a way that puts the District’s systems, data, students, staff, and faculty at risk. Prior to initial use on the District network or related infrastructure, all mobile devices must be registered with IT. WCCCD District IT will maintain a list of approved mobile devices, related software applications, and utilities as needed. Devices that are not on this list may not be connected to District infrastructure. Although IT currently allows only listed devices to be connected to District infrastructure, it reserves the right to update this list in the future. End users who wish to connect such devices to non-college network infrastructure to gainaccess to college data must employ, for their devices and related infrastructure, security measures deemed necessary by the IT department, such as updated software, anti-virus software, and personal firewall. District data is not to be accessed on any hardware that fails to meet WCCCD’s established IT security standards. All mobile devices attempting to connect to the District network through an unmanaged network (i.e., the Internet) will be inspected using technology centrally managed by WCCCD’s IT department. Devices that have not been previously approved by IT, are not in compliance with IT’s security policies or represent any threat to the District network or data will not be allowed to connect. Laptop computers or personal PCs may only access the District network using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. Security Without exception, employees using mobile devices and related software for network and data access will use secure data management procedures. All mobile devices must be protected by a strong password. See the WCCCD’s password policy for additional details. Employees agree never to disclose their passwords to anyone. All users of mobile devices must employ reasonable physical security measures. End users are expected to secure all such devices used for this activity whether or not they are actually in use and/or being carried. This includes, but is not limited to, passwords, encryption, and physical control of such devices whenever they contain WCCCD data. Any non-District computers synchronizing with these devices will have installed anti-virus and anti-malware software deemed necessary by WCCCD’s IT department. Anti-virus signature files on any additional client machines – such as a home PC – on which this media will be accessed must be up to date. IT will centrally manage security policies, network, application, and data access using whatever technology solutions it deems suitable. Any attempt to contravene or bypass said security implementation will be deemed an intrusion attempt and will be dealt with in accordance with WCCCD’s overarching security policy. Employees, contractors, Full-time faculty, part-time faculty, and temporary staff will follow all WCCCD-sanctioned data removal procedures to permanently erase WCCCDspecific data from such devices once their use is no longer required. If a lost or stolen mobile device is lost, the user must report this to IT immediately. The device will be remotely wiped off all data and locked to prevent access by anyone other than IT. If the device is recovered, it can be submitted to IT for reprovisioning. Employees, contractors, Full-time faculty, part-time faculty, and temporary staff will make no modifications of any kind to WCCCD-owned and installed hardware or software without the approval of the WCCCD Division of Information technology. This includes, but is not limited to, any reconfiguration of the mobile device. Division of Information Technology reserves the right, through policy enforcement and any other means it deems necessary, to limit the ability of end users to transfer data to and from specific resources on the WCCCD network. Organizational Protocol Division of Information Technology can and will establish audit trails and these will be accessed and used without notice. Such trails will be able to track the attachment of an external device to a PC, and the resulting reports may be used for investigation of possible breaches and/or misuse.

Basic First Aid The District Police Authority Department can assist with minor injuries like cuts, scrapes, bruises, sprains, strains, insect bites, and bee stings. However, they do not provide medications, including aspirin. If someone requires medical treatment for a non-life-threatening issue, it’s the individual’s responsibility to arrange for transportation. The Department does not offer transport for medical reasons. For seizure victims, the Department will help keep the person safe until the Rescue Team arrives. If the seizure victim prefers not to contact the Fire and Rescue Department, they must fill out a waiver for ambulance transport. Reporting a Fire In the event of a fire, the District Police Authority Department will immediately alert the local Fire and Rescue Department. Officers will assist with evacuation and manage traffic to ensure emergency vehicles have clear access to the scene. Emergency Phones Emergency Telephones are available throughout the campus in key locations. These phones can be used to report crimes, suspicious activity, medical emergencies, or safety concerns. Activating an emergency phone alerts the District Police Authority Communications Center, and officers will respond to the location, even if there’s no voice contact. Emergency Reaction Plan An Emergency Reaction Plan is available at each District Police Authority office, providing quick guidance for various emergencies. Campus Emergency Response and Evacuation This plan aims to ensure safety and minimize damage during an emergency. The first priority in any situation is to take care of yourself. Faculty and staff should inform others about safe zones and emergency exits. Individuals with disabilities should arrange for assistance with volunteers from their classes or offices. They may also request a meeting with the Administration office to review evacuation procedures. In an emergency, call the District Police Authority at the designated number. If there's no immediate answer, dial 911. Follow all instructions given and do not hang up until you're certain no further information is needed. When reporting an emergency, clearly state, “This is an emergency,” and provide the following information: The nature of the emergency Your name Your phone number Your location Campus Emergency Procedures Evacuating During a Fire Alarm If a fire alarm sounds, please evacuate the building: Move quickly but calmly to the nearest exit and continue to a safe distance (approximately 100 yards) from the building.
